<h2><a name="section1">FAQ/Help</a></h2>

<h3>What is smartn.me?</h3>
<p>smartn.me is an alternative way to fund your education. This site was created to combat the rising debt from student loans and to shine a light on the many different ways that people are educating themselves around the world.</p>

<h3>How exactly does smartn.me work?</h3>
<p>smartn.me is a crowdfunding platform to aide students in raising money to fund their studies. All campaigns must have an educational purpose and a specified time period (between 1 and 90 days). After a campaign is approved, the student has to engage their community & networks to raise the money that has been requested. When a deadline is reached there will be one of two outcomes, which we call the “all-or-nothing” approach:
</br>1. The Successful campaign: if the goal is reached or exceeded, the campaign owner gets all of the money raised.
</br>2. The Unsuccessful campaign: if the goal isn't reached, we will return all contributions to the supporters of that campaign and the student gets nothing.</p>

<h3>And why all-or-nothing?</h3>
<p>Simply put: It's less risky</i>. Donors need to be sure that you'll use the money accordingly, and we assume that the minimum amount you’ve requested is the amount necessary to carry out your goal. If you don’t reach this monetary target, then it would be very difficult to fund the goal you're pursuing.</li>
The "All or Nothing" approach definitely gives extra motivation to be proactive in your attempt at raising money</i>. Your task is to get as many people involved as possible. When people see that you are enthusiastic and actively working to fund your education, they will be more inclined to help.</p>

<h3>What type of campaigns can be found on smartn.me?</h3>
<p>smartn.me is dedicated to educational campaigns only, however this doesn’t mean that it’s only for college students. At smartn.me we disagree with the notion that an education has to come from a university. We challenge people all over the world to think outside of the box and take a more proactive approach to learning and bettering themselves. With that being said here are just a few examples of what this encompasses: college, art school, exam fees &amp; test preparation, tuition, books, specialized training courses, studying abroad, ETC. If you have any questions about the types of campaigns that will be accepted, just send us an email and we’d be happy to discuss it with you. Or submit your campaign and we’ll contact you within two days to let you know if it’s approved or not.

We challenge people all over the world to think outside the box and take a more proactive approach to learning and bettering themselves. With that being said, here are just a few examples of what this encompasses: college, trade school, studying abroad, exam fees, test preparation, tuition, books, specialized training courses, ETC. If you have any questions about the types of campaigns that will be accepted, just send us an email and we’d be happy to discuss it with you. Or submit your campaign and we’ll contact you within two days to let you know if it’s approved or not. 
We are passionate about learning and we’d love to know the vehicle you’ve chosen to help you further your education.</p>

<h3>Is smartn.me just for students?</h3>
<p>No! smartn.me would love to reach out to educators as well. We understand that there have been several budget cuts within the public school system, so we encourage you to utilize crowdfunding to aide you in purchasing school supplies or other materials for learning. You may also have a big class trip that you’d like to plan. smartn.me is a great resource to help you tap into the crowd and achieve your goals as an educator.</p>

<h3>What is the duration of each campaign?</h3>
<p>Campaigns can differ in length, from 1 day to 90 days. We encourage each student to carefully plan their campaign and give themselves enough time to execute it effectively.</p>

<h3>Why do people contribute to these campaigns?</h3>
<p>Many people dig the idea of contributing to something much greater than themselves, or perhaps “paying it forward.”  These campaigns will only be successful if people contribute. Fear not, because donating a truckload of money is not necessary. Most campaigns offer rewards starting at $ 10.00.</p>

<h2><a name="section2">Supporting A Campaign</a></h2>

<h3>How can I support a campaign?</h3>
<p>When you are on the campaign page, click on the green button that reads "Back This campaign" (located on the right side of the screen). After that, a blank field will appear for you to enter the amount that you would like to contribute, and from there you can select a reward.
On the next screen, you will be redirected to Paypal's secure website where you will be prompted to continue by paying with your Paypal account. 
After offering your financial support you may opt to spread the word to other people that you know who may be interested in contributing.</p>

<h3>How does the payment process work?</h3>
<p>After you support the campaign through a secure Paypal transaction, the money will go to the smartn.me Paypal account. Then there are two possibilities:
  <ul class="list-style">
    <li>If the campaign is successful, we will reward the value of the campaign to the owner. See question "How do the creators of the campaigns receive money…"</li> 
    <li>If the campaign is not successful, you will receive your money back in the form of credits on your smartn.me account soon after the fundraising deadline of the campaign you supported. From there you can support another campaign or if you prefer to have your money back, no problem: Just go to “My credits” (click on your username, up at the right corner of the screen) and select “Request Reversal.” If the payment is made by Paypal, you will have 100% money back, but only if the cancellation is requested within 60 days after your payment has been completed. If you fail to request the money within the 60 days, Paypal transaction fees (2.9% + R $ 0.30) will be deducted from the amount to be reversed.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Why do you use Paypal?</h3>
<p>Paypal is the largest electronic payment system in the world.  They ensure safe transactions and attention to detail. The payments are processed directly through Paypal, so neither smartn.me nor the student that you're supporting will have access to your credit information. (See our Privacy Policy for more details)
Using Paypal also allows us to accept International currencies from all over the globe, so that won’t be an obstacle for you in your funding endeavors.</p>

<h3>Do I need a Paypal account to support a campaign?</h3>
<p>No. You can use your preferred credit card with Paypal's “Visitor Payment” option</h3>

<h3>What information will the student receive if I support their campaign?</h3>
<p>They will know your smartn.me username (unless you’ve chosen to donate anonymously), your email address, the value that you donated, & which reward you selected.</p>

<h3>Will the amount that I contribute be shown publicly?</h3>
<p>Definitely not. Only the student will receive this information.</p>

<h3>What if I want my support to be anonymous?</h3>
<p>No problem!  Just select the option “I want my support to be anonymous” located on the “give support page.”  
We respect your rights to privacy, however allowing the public to view your support only increases the reputation of the student and encourages more support. 
Moreover, the value of your donation will not be disclosed to anyone other than the owner of the campaign (who will always know who you are).</p>

<h3>Will I receive a message when the campaign that I’ve supported ends?</h3>
<p>Yes.  Whether the campaign is successful, or not, you will receive an email.</p>

<h2><a name="section3">Submitting Your campaign</a></h2>

<h3>What do I need to submit for my campaign?</h3>
<p>First check out the "Submit Your Campaign" area in the top right corner of the site; there we explained more about smartn.me, and provide some tips on building your campaign. Afterwards,  fill in the required details and submit your campaign. 
It’s best that you be as detailed as possible in your campaign description, so that your donors will be fully informed about what they are contributing to. Consider providing an acceptance letter, a detailed breakdown of your tuition & fees, a video from a guidance counselor or academic advisor on your behalf, or even a video journal of your progress. Be as detailed, transparent, and creative as possible.</p>

<h3>Will every campaign be approved on the site?</h3>
<p>No. The approval process is more strict than general crowdfunding sites and we have a team that’s responsible for evaluating each campaign. 
We will not judge the vehicle you’ve chosen to further your education; we simply want to ensure that the campaign fits within our educational guidelines and demonstrates an effort by the student to further their education.
   We want to know all about the background and level of ambition of each student and why they are attempting to engage their community in fundraising.  
Here are a few reasons why we have a strict approval process:
  <ul class="list-style">
    <li>We want to reduce the risk of having people use the site for malicious activity;</li>
    <li>We want to ensure that the student is serious about partnering with their community to raise funds as this is one of the most fundamental steps of each campaign;</li>
    <li>We want to ensure that the campaign is in-line with the smartn.me message</li>
    <li>Protecting our donors is a top priority</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>What kind of response can I expect after I submit my campaign?</h3>
<p>There are three possibilities:  (1) we will approve the campaign and you will receive a notification that your campaign is “live” (2) If the campaign is unclear, we will send you more questions so that we can get a better understanding of your goals (3) expect a polite rejection notice if the campaign detracts from the smartn.me message.</p>
  
<h3>How long do I have to wait for a response from smartn.me?</h3> 
<p>No more than two days, including weekends.</p>

<h2><a name="section4">Payments &amp; Fees</a></h2>

<h3>How will the students receive their money if the campaign is successful?</h3>
<p>First, they must have an account through Paypal in order to receive payment. The payment process will be done in two steps, 30 days apart. The first wave of money distributed will be from the donations received prior to the 30 day mark before the campaign ends, and will be awarded 2 business days after the campaign ends. The second wave of payments will occur after all the last minute donations clear which could take up to 30 days. 
 The reason for two payments  is to ensure that all credit card & debit card payments, especially those entered in the last 30 days of the campaign, have had time to be processed and cleared. We will also send a report that details your donations & fees.</p>

<h3>Does smartn.me deduct a percentage?</h3>
<p>Yes, smartn.me deducts 5% from successful campaigns to cover site maintenance & operational costs. If your campaign doesn’t reach it’s goal then smartn.me refunds ALL of the donated money.</p>

<h3>What is the fee charged by Paypal?</h3>
<p>The rate that the campaign owner will have to pay varies with the form of payment that is chosen by the sponsor. Credit card payments usually have higher rates. Based on cases that we’ve had so far, this rate averages to be about 2.9% + $0.30 (international rates may vary). This rate will be applied to each transaction.<p>

<h3>Does it cost anything to put a campaign on smartn.me?</h3>
<p>Nope! It’s absolutely FREE to post a campaign on smartn.me</p>

<h3>What is the maximum amount of funding that my campaign can raise?</h3>
<p>There is no maximum limit.</p>

<h3>Is there a minimum amount that I’m able to receive?</h3>
<p>Yes. The minimum value is $10.</p>

<h3>How do you handle intellectual property?</h3>
<p>It is and always will be 100% property of the student or original uploader.</p>

<h2><a name="section5">Your Campaign</a></h2>

<h3>Can my campaign be edited after it’s released?</h3>
<p>Yes. The only items that can not be changed are: the purpose of financing, the deadline, and the rewards that have been selected. For now, to make these changes you have to send an email to us at <a href="mailto:contact@smartn.me">contact@smartn.me</a>, but hopefully in the near future you will be able to do this directly from the site.</p>

<h3>If my campaign has raised money before the deadline, can I request for it to end early?</h3>
<p>No, you have to wait until the deadline. This is a great opportunity for you to engage your community to get extra support!</p>

<h3>Can I edit some information from my campaign after the campaign deadline?</h3>
<p>No, but you can use the “Updates” tab to continue engaging with supporters or others who become interested in your campaign.</p>

<h3>Can a campaign be deleted from smartn.me?</h3>
<p>If it has already been released to the public, No. Even if it is not funded, it will continue to be on the site, for the sake of transparency.</p>

<h3>Can I contribute to my own campaign?</h3>
<p>Absolutely not. This would be grounds for disqualification, because it defeats the spirit of tapping into the crowd and it is viewed as dishonest behavior.  Also Paypal will not process a donation to you from you. Think about it.</p>

<h3>Can I cancel my campaign?</h3>
<p>Yes you can. For this you will need to send an email to <a href="mailto:contact@smartn.me">contact@smartn.me</a>. We will also need a reasonable explanation about why you’ve chosen cancel you campaign so that we may notify everyone who contributed to your campaign. In this case, your campaign will appear in the section labeled "unfunded."</p>

<h2><a name="section6">Rewards, Rewards, Rewards!</a></h2>

<h3>Who creates the rewards?</h3>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to come up with a way to reward each donation.
The rewards can vary in range according to the donation. For example, if you contribute $10.00 you get one reward; or if you contribute $50.00 you gain another.</p>

<h3>Why do I have to offer a reward?</h3>
<p>You don’t have to offer any rewards, but we encourage you to do so becasuse this really gives donors more incentive to participate and be included in on your journey to achieving a higher education.</p>

<h3>What can be offered as a reward?</h3>
<p>Virtually everything except money or anything illegal. Products, services, and experiences can be included in the package. No need to break the bank to reward your supporters just be creative!  There’s nothing better than a personalized tour in the Country where you happen to be studying abroad, a postcard that updates your progress, a costume design from fashion school, a ticket to that advanced piano recital, or free computer service when you’ve completed that IT course (You get our drift). The rewards should be a fun & creative way to encourage people to support your campaign.</p>

<h3>How can I get information (email address, shirt sizes, mailing address, etc.) about the supporters of my campaign so that I can distribute the rewards?</h3>
<p>On the list of supporters of the campaign, you’ll see the email addresses of all supporters. You should contact them personally to obtain any other necessary information.</p>

<h3>Who is responsible for the delivery of rewards?</h3>
<p>ONLY the student will be held responsible for the delivery of rewards. smartn.me is only a facilitator of the process.</p>
