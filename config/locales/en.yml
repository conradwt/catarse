    hints:
      project:
        name: What's the name of your campaign? Be specific, because this will influence the chances of your campaign reaching its goal.
        video_url: This video introduces you to potential supporters who want to know all about you and your education goals. While an Oscar worthy video is not necessary, we do require a video in order for your campaign to be accepted. <strong>Paste the URL from your <a href="http://vimeo.com" target="_blank">Vimeo</a> video.</strong> We use Vimeo because they support high-quality videos with no ads.
        about: Give us the details of your master plan! What's your background? Where are you going? What are you studying? How much money do you need? How will the money be used? Try to be as specific as possible so that potential supporters will be inspired to get involved.
        headline: Summarize your campaign in 140 characters or less. Your headline will be the first thing people see when viewing your campaign. Be creative and concise!
        category: Choose a category that best suits your campaign. Don't worry if you think it fits in more than one. Choose the one where you want people to find your campaign.
        goal: Think hard about the amount you need and be sure to account for <a href="http://smartn.me/en/faq#section4" target="_blank">standard transaction fees</a>. The amount should be the <strong>minimum necessary to achieve the campaign's goal</strong>. Nothing more, nothing less. If you ask for too much, your chances of reaching the minimum will be lower; if you don't ask for enough, you won't be able to carry out your plans.
        expires_at: "Finally, choose how long you want your campaign to last. Give yourself enough time to rally enough support to reach your goal amount, but beware that an extended period could bore potential supporters."
